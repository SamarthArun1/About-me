    <p>My career goal is to become a game developer. I have played many extremely good games which has inspired me to make my own game. To achieve this I am going to learn to code and make my own game to show that I am capable.</p>
    <p>While I don't have much experience in this field, I am a fast learner and I am dedicated. I started playing soccer in 7th grade and after just two years I am better than some of my teammates who have been playing since elementary school</p>
    <p>Playing soccer has also made me good at working with a team and I am able to accept the ideas of others</p>
    <p>I have over 5 medals from soccer tournaments and I am part of speech and debate. I am also planning on joining the high school soccer and track teams.</p>
